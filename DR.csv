"Consider this post: ""Ancestry.com - is it safe? Hello!: ) I'm a new user so if this post ends up in a weird place/thread, pls bear w me. Has anyone used Ancestry.com lately? They offer a two week trial but still require your credit card information. Is this suspicious? It doesn't cost anything for the first two weeks, and then you can end the trial so you don't have to pay anything even then, but I just feel a little uncomfortable dialing my credit card information on there online.... Am I being too doubtfull? Share your experiences? Thank you! If my English isn't perfect, that's because I'm not a native speaker."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not exhibit strong emotional indicators of depression. It primarily focuses on a specific concern regarding the safety of using Ancestry.com and asking for advice and experiences from other users. While there is a slight hint of uncertainty or doubt, it does not prominently display the profound hopelessness, despair, or self-esteem issues commonly associated with depression. The tone of the post seems more pragmatic and seeking information rather than expressing overwhelming emotional distress. Additionally, the mention of being a non-native English speaker suggests that any imperfections in the writing could be attributed to language fluency rather than emotional distress."
"Consider this post: ""Dini ticaret haline getirenler"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression.

"Consider this post: ""My mother and her tragically unlucky family Hey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance. My mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go; So my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two. But it gets unluckier. So, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later) 1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that). But again, it gets unluckier. Four years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal. So during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family. So 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was. So my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband. I never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born. The ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff. So my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it?"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post exhibits strong emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster describes a tragic and unlucky history within their mother's side of the family, expressing feelings of shock, fascination, and a sense of being cursed. The mention of multiple deaths, accidents, and dysfunctional family dynamics contributes to a sense of hopelessness and despair. The poster also mentions their uncle's addiction, abusive behavior, and rejection of the family, further adding to the emotional distress expressed in the post. The overall tone is one of deep sadness, highlighting the overwhelming impact of the family's misfortunes on the poster's emotional well-being."
"Consider this post: ""A vent more than advice post my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave she messages me saying ""bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me"" half an hour later she messages again saying ""bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his."" and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row. not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me. tl;dr - today i feel like i've been put on the backburner, and i'm not any kind of priority when it comes to time spent with my friend. and it sucks."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post mainly expresses frustration and disappointment with a friend changing plans and not prioritizing the poster's time. While there may be some underlying emotions of hurt or feeling unimportant, the post does not exhibit the profound sense of emotional pain, hopelessness, or numbness typically associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more focused on the specific incident and its impact on the poster's plans, rather than addressing deeper emotional issues commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""I need advice : what was the moment that proved and showed you that you did or didn't want kids? I'm trying to find out if I myself would one day want kids of my own. I am a female in my early 20ties and as of now the answer is no, I don't see myself having or wanting kids now or anytime in the near future. However there's still the far future; I want to know if people have a change of heart about this ? Will I stay with the oppinion I have now forever ? I'm not asking to be convinced of being a parent because I don't see having kids or not having kids as a right or wrong. I simply want to be able to find out if I will also not want any in the distant future."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post does not display emotional indicators of very severe depression. The poster is seeking advice and experiences from others regarding the decision to have children. While there is a slight sense of uncertainty and questioning about the future, it does not convey a deep sense of hopelessness or emotional distress commonly associated with very severe depression. The tone of the post is more introspective and curious rather than despairing or overwhelmed."
"Consider this post: ""Anyone ever wish they were good at something? Something. Anything. Be it something innocuous or something that can get you a kickass job. Anything from which you could derive happiness and fulfillment. I've failed at everything I've tried. Good at absolutely nothing, even after years of trying. If there were even one such thing, I could just devote myself to it and use it to keep myself busy."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post expresses a deep sense of failure and lack of accomplishment in various areas of life. The poster expresses a desire to be good at something, anything, that could bring happiness and fulfillment. The mention of having failed at everything they have tried and feeling good at absolutely nothing implies a significant level of self-doubt and low self-esteem. The poster also expresses a desire to find something to keep themselves busy, suggesting a lack of fulfillment and purpose in their life. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression, indicating that the poster may be suffering from depression."
"Consider this post: ""Anyone want to talk with me tonight? Just lonely, need to get out of my head."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post demonstrates a feeling of loneliness and a desire to connect with others. The poster expresses a need to talk to someone and get out of their own thoughts, suggesting a sense of isolation and possibly a lack of social support. While the post does not explicitly mention emotional distress, the mention of loneliness and the desire to escape one's own thoughts can be indicative of depressive symptoms."
"Consider this post: ""Who even cares anymore I’ve just learned to accept my thought and I realise things aren’t gonna get better.I have the same cycle every day just play video games mourn for death wish I had weed and listen to sad songs till the morning life has just become such a boring shit show. Even talking to random people has me fucked up cause i fuck things up tell me guys what’s the point of even living anymore"" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","Yes, the poster suffers from depression. Reasoning: The post suggests a deep sense of apathy, hopelessness, and a lack of motivation or enjoyment in life. The poster describes engaging in activities such as playing video games, mourning, and listening to sad songs as a way to cope, but even these activities seem to bring little joy or fulfillment. The mention of wanting weed as a means of escape suggests a desire to numb or escape from emotional pain. The question about the point of living anymore highlights a significant level of despair and questioning of the meaning or purpose of life. These emotional indicators align with symptoms commonly associated with depression."
"Consider this post: ""How I'm coping with the end of a friendship... I'm writing this partly because I find it therapeutic and partly because I'm hoping it'll help others.( I have self-proclaimed good coping skills.) So, my XBFF didn't do anything [i]to[/i] me. There was no defining moment. I just decided that (as much as I love her) she doesn't compliment my life anymore. She's having a few relationship issues. As a married woman, I empathize with her. However, over the last 6 months she's started to get a little... Crazy. I'm a very blunt and controversial person. Always have been, always will be. I keep an IG account full of controversial and offensive memes. Some people like it, some people don't. Anyway, I've been going through a rough time myself so I cope by posting passive-aggressive memes. Every single thing I post she takes personally. It got to the point in which everything I said or did (online or in the real world) she somehow thought was about her. It wasn't. It got to the point in which I was afraid to speak because I was afraid she'd take something the wrong way. Anyway, she went an entire week without speaking to me even though I sent her multiple texts. Maybe this was the moment, but I decided that I will not tolerate that type of power struggle. We're adults - you don't get to ignore someone because you don't like what they're saying and that's always been an issue with her: if she doesn't like what you have to say she comes up with delusional explanations as to why. Basically, she can never be wrong and if you think one negative thing about something related to her, she'll freak out, accuse you of being jealous even though she's the one not actually happy. The negativity is starting with her. For example, we tried to book a trip together. We've been trying for years and they never happen. Finally, I just told her that I'm no longer interested in planning trips with her because she's not willing to accommodate my demanding work schedule. Now, she's the first to admit her job is shit and it's been a huge source of insecurity for her, but when I tell her that my job doesn't allow me to book off as easily as hers (she works cash and doesn't really have a true job) she'll freak out and accuse me of putting her down. No. I'm stating the facts: You can book off your job easily. I can't. That's not me putting down your job. That's me telling you why I can't tell my boss on Friday I'm leaving for two weeks the following Monday. (This is just one example, but they all pretty much follow the same context: Something TRUE she doesn't like about herself is brought to attention and she accuses you of being a bad friend.) After a week of being MIA she decides to text me. No. It doesn't work like that. I'm not interested in what she has to say. So, I tell her to get over herself, not everything in the world revolves around her, etc. Of course, she thinks she's completely innocent and that all she was trying to do was explain HER feelings and I tell her I'm not interested. Again, it's not always about her. She did not once seek clarification about ANYTHING I said. She jumped to random conclusions and just assumed I sit here and think about her. In the end, that's what frustrates me. I just can't be friends with someone who thinks everything is about her. In sum, I just decided to protect myself."" Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?","No, the poster does not suffer from depression. Reasoning: The post indicates some frustration and dissatisfaction with a friend, but it does not convey significant emotional distress or symptoms commonly associated with depression. The poster primarily discusses their decision to end a friendship due to conflicts and communication issues. Although there may be some emotional impact from the situation, the overall tone of the post seems more assertive and self-protective, rather than indicating severe depression."
